# Owaria

Roadmap
	+ Animations
	+ Jumping
	+ Movement
	+ Slopy tile mechanics
	+ Background for map
	+ Tilemap buildings
	+ Map objects: sensor object
	+ Ladder mechanics
	- Dust effect on player drop on tile
	
	- Code Review: delete GameObjectData.h, BuildingObjectData.h, ?EffectData.h? files. Implement get clone and set functions;
	- Code Review: move loaders of cfg's into a unility header
	- Code Review: Physics has to use force or impulse instead of setting its speed. Change friction density restitution values with more realistic ones.
	
	- Player arrow shooting mechanics
	- Mobs
	- Map mob handler(respawn etc.)
	- Opimized rendering
	-
